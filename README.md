# StarterEdit
A small GUI application written in C# that allows you to edit the starting Pokemon in Pokemon Red/Blue.
The program also enables you to edit the levels and which Pokemon your rival has in their party. I eventually want to add support for editing individual Pokemon stats and data. 

## Requirements
Pokemon Red/Blue rom file

[Requires .Netcore 3.1](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1)
